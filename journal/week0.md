# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

I set up the admin user and got an error as the admin user doesn't have the right to access the billing.
Then created a billing policy to grant access rights to the admin group.
Post that was able to generate the alarm.
Downloaded the AWS SDK and set the AWS credentials locally.
